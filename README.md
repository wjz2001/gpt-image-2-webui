## Turn GPT Image into a real creative workspace

ImgX Studio is a premium WebUI for **GPT Image / OpenAI-compatible image APIs**. It helps designers, marketers, product teams, and AI creators move from idea to production-ready visual in one focused flow: write a brief, upload references, tune output specs, generate multiple candidates, pick the strongest image, then keep iterating from that result.

If you want a beautiful, customizable, self-hosted **gpt-image-2 WebUI**, ImgX Studio is designed to be the fastest path from API access to a usable product.

## Why teams choose ImgX Studio

| What you need | How ImgX Studio helps |
| --- | --- |
| A polished image-generation UI | Modern Next.js interface with a designer-friendly control panel and clean result grid. |
| Reliable creative output | Requests 1-4 images as separate calls to reduce missing results from batch limits. |
| Text-to-image and image-to-image | Generate from a prompt or upload up to 4 references for edits, variations, and extensions. |
| Iteration, not one-off prompts | Select any generated image as the next source and continue with remix actions. |
| Flexible API routing | Use browser-direct requests or a server proxy through `/api/images` to keep keys on the server. |
| OpenAI-compatible endpoints | Base URLs are normalized automatically for `/v1/images/generations` and `/v1/images/edits`. |
| Global-ready interface | Ships with UI copy for 9 languages and dedicated README files for each supported language. |

## Built for high-value image workflows

| Workflow | Example use case |
| --- | --- |
| Product hero shots | Turn product photos into premium e-commerce visuals, ads, and social covers. |
| Campaign exploration | Generate several creative directions, compare them quickly, and branch from the strongest option. |
| Commercial retouching | Use a result as the source image, then refine artifacts, material realism, lighting, and composition. |
| Controlled variations | Keep the subject and layout stable while exploring backgrounds, angles, mood, and styling. |
| Private team deployment | Run it on your own server or Vercel for internal design, marketing, or content teams. |

## Highlight features

- **Designed for gpt-image-2**: includes `gpt-image-2`, `gpt-image-2-2026-04-21`, and `gpt-image-1` model options.
- **Reference-aware generation**: upload PNG, JPG, or WEBP reference images, up to 4 files and 10MB per file.
- **Creative iteration board**: choose a result, set it as the active source, then generate the next branch.
- **Remix recipes**: quickly apply variation, commercial polish, hero upscale, or local redraw instructions.
- **Output control**: choose smart, square, landscape, portrait, 2K, 4K, or custom dimensions from 64-8192 px per side.
- **Production formats**: export PNG, JPEG, or WEBP with auto, opaque, or transparent background modes.
- **Privacy-aware key handling**: store connection settings only in local browser storage, or keep server keys in `OPENAI_API_KEY`.
- **Localized product experience**: language switcher, locale-aware metadata, UI labels, prompt presets, and error messages.

## Tech stack

- [Next.js 16](https://nextjs.org/) + React 19
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS 4
- shadcn/ui + Base UI
- OpenAI Node SDK
- Sonner Toast

## Quick Start

### 1. Clone

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd gpt-image-2-webui
```

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Configure environment variables

For **browser direct** mode, you can skip server environment variables and enter the API key directly in the UI.

For **server proxy** mode, copy the example file:

```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
```

Then fill in:

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
```

### 4. Start the dev server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## How to use

1. Enter a prompt or start from a built-in prompt preset.
2. Optionally upload PNG / JPG / WEBP references, up to 4 images and 10MB per image.
3. Choose size, quality, output format, background, and image count.
4. Select a connection mode:
   - **Browser direct**: the browser calls your endpoint directly; the endpoint must support CORS.
   - **Server proxy**: the app forwards requests through `/api/images` and can use `OPENAI_API_KEY`.
5. Generate images, select the strongest result, download it, or set it as the source image for the next round.

## Environment variables

| Variable | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | No | Used by server proxy mode. A key entered in the UI takes priority; otherwise the server env value is used. |
| `NEXT_ASSET_PREFIX` | No | Sets the static asset prefix for sub-path or CDN deployments. |

## Deploy

### Vercel

1. Fork this repository.
2. Import it into Vercel.
3. Add `OPENAI_API_KEY` in Vercel Project Settings if you want server proxy mode.
4. Deploy and open your project domain.

### Node.js / Docker-like environments

The project uses Next.js `standalone` output:

```bash
npm run build
npm run start
```

## API key and privacy

- In browser-direct mode, the API key is sent from the browser to the endpoint you configure.
- If you enable **Remember on this device**, the API key and base URL are stored only in the current browser's `localStorage`.
- In server-proxy mode, `OPENAI_API_KEY` can stay on the server so team members do not need to enter a shared key repeatedly.

## Roadmap

- [ ] Generation history
- [ ] Prompt template management
- [ ] Project / canvas grouping
- [ ] More model provider presets
- [ ] Dockerfile and one-click deployment templates

## Contributing

Issues and pull requests are welcome, especially for:

- OpenAI-compatible endpoint adapters
- Better prompt presets
- Localization improvements
- Workflow and UI refinements
- Deployment examples and docs

If ImgX Studio saves you time building a gpt-image-2 WebUI, consider starring the project and sharing it with creators who need a better AI image workflow.
